# Disclaimer
It goes without saying that without the brilliant minds behind these works, this Scrivener template wouldn‚Äôt be possible. I also have taken the liberty of adding some of my own tricks and tips for helping you use this template.

Credit goes to all of the hard working writers that have shared their knowledge with the Internet. I must make it abundantly clear that I do not own a lot of the work that has been compiled in this template. I put it together for the sake of convenience, and offline use since I don‚Äôt always have access to the Internet on my travels.

Please support the original authors as well‚Ä¶and me too, I‚Äôd appreciate a coffee! üòâ

# What is Included?
Along with the Scrivener template, you‚Äôll also be getting Word, Excel templates for you to use. You will also receive an All-In-One Template Codex should you use the Office templates that are provided for ease of use. The All-In-One Template Codex is included in the Codex folder of this template. The Codex will contain files that explain to use a certain template. It will give you examples of different types of things, and go further into information about certain topics should you need the explanation. I do plan to make filled out templates, so you can have a better idea of how to use them, and then interpret the data for your benefit.

# How to Use this Template
## Scrivener Template
Using this template is rather easy. Most of the templates I‚Äôve put together are fill-in-the blank, courtesy of World Anvil, so all you‚Äôd really have to do is select the folder that you want to work in, then locate the green plus button, and click on the drop-down arrow. This will reveal a small menu, then hover your mouse over the template category that you wish to use, then find the template that you wish to use and click on it.

Mind you, you can also click on entire categories, and it will generate based off of what is included in that folder. This is especially useful when you want to generate specific file structures, for example, the 3 Act, 9 Block, 27 Chapters File Structure template. Unfortunately, Scrivener doesn‚Äôt have a way to automatically select your generated template and rename them on the spot. Hopefully this will be addressed in the upcoming Scrivener 3.

You can begin by simply filling-in-the-blank with the information that you desire. Of course, these portions of the templates can have Scrivener Links embedded in them for faster navigation.

## Word Documents
To use these, all you really have to do is export the ‚Äúaio-msdocuments.zip‚Äù file into the ‚ÄúCustom Office Templates‚Äù folder that is located in your documents folder, should you be on Windows. From there, you simply open up Word or Excel and then click on the ‚ÄúPersonal‚Äù templates tab, and the documents will populate there. From here, you can pick your desired template, e.g. Character 1, and then begin populating and saving documents as you please. It‚Äôs that simple.
